# MyReads Project

This project was created by Lupe Barriga, for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegre. This Application/project is designated to be used to search for book titles and store them on different book cabinets/shelfs. It provided the feature to sort them by what you are currently reading, what you have read and what you would like to read.

## Getting Started

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
